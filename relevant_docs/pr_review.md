1. Scope & Focus
Reviewer	Key Point	Rationale
@droot	Keep this PR narrowly focused on providing Bedrock support only. Remove or defer “usage” tracking, extended configuration knobs, and other cross-provider features.	Easier to review/merge and avoids partial implementations that would have to be replicated for every LLM provider.
@zvdy	Agrees with limiting scope; advanced options are nice but not critical for first pass.	Maintains momentum and reduces maintenance overhead.

2. Configuration & Advanced Settings
File / Topic	Requested Change	Details
docs/bedrock.md examples (top-p, max-retries, region, timeout)	Drop or hide advanced flags for now.	Use environment variables for provider-specific tuning until there’s a universal config story.
InferenceConfig additions in gollm/factory.go	Remove from this PR.	Same reasoning—avoid introducing new config surfaces that other providers don’t yet support.
Custom Debug flag	Don’t add; rely on existing logging flags.	Keeps the flag space consistent across providers.

3. Usage Metrics
Area	Feedback
UsageCallback, UsageExtractor, Usage struct work	Exclude for now. Usage tracking must be designed once for all providers; implementing just for Bedrock complicates the interface.

4. Documentation
Section	Action Items
Bedrock docs	Keep only Bedrock-specific content (auth, region ARN format, quirks).
Region-specific model list	Replace static table with a link to AWS official page (source of truth will change).
Streaming, custom timeouts, generic flags	Move to main README.md if they’re provider-agnostic; otherwise drop for now.
Contributing	Remove from docs/bedrock.md; it’s already covered at repo level.

5. Code Review Notes
File	Comment
gollm/factory.go – duplicated fmt.Errorf line	Reviewer asked why this change was needed; revert unless there’s a bug fix.
General style	Strip out unnecessary comments (done).
Tests	Ensure timeout tests are robust to env speed differences; reviewers can’t run Bedrock themselves, so your local verification matters.

6. CI Failures
verify-format – run go fmt ./... and goimports -w

verify-gomod – run go mod tidy to sync dependencies

7. Next Steps Checklist
Re-scope:

Remove Usage* interfaces and related wiring.

Drop advanced config fields & debug flag.

Docs:

Trim Bedrock guide to provider-specific essentials.

Link out to AWS docs for model availability.

Move/omit generic sections.

CI:

Fix formatting & go.mod inconsistencies.

Address inline comments in each affected file.

Push updates, then ping reviewers for a second pass.
