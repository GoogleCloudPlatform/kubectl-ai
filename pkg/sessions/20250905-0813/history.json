Let's take a popular instance type for general purpose compute as an example â€” an instance with about 4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM:\n\n- AWS (t3.xlarge or m5.xlarge): Roughly $0.15 to $0.20 per hour on-demand pricing.\n- Azure (D4s v3): Roughly $0.18 to $0.22 per hour on-demand.\n- Google Cloud (n1-standard-4): Roughly $0.15 to $0.20 per hour on-demand.\n\nThese prices will vary based on region and exact instance specs, discounts, reserved instances, sustained use discounts, and other factors. But generally, you can expect:\n\n- All three providers have roughly comparable pricing in the $100 to $160 per month range for this category.\n- AWS and Google Cloud tend to be similar in pricing.\n- Azure is often slightly more expensive, but not drastically.\n\nIf you want a more specific cost comparison for another resource or a different configuration, just let me know!","Timestamp":"2025-09-05T09:30:27.663746193Z"}
