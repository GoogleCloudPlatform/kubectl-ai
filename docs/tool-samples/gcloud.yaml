  command_desc: |
    The gcloud CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer workflow, and interactions with Google Cloud APIs.

    For Kubernetes-related tasks, the `gcloud container clusters` command group is the most relevant.

    Core subcommands and usage patterns:
    - `gcloud container clusters list [flags]`: List all GKE clusters in the configured project and zone/region.
    - `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster-name> [flags]`: Get detailed information about a specific GKE cluster.
    - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> [flags]`: Fetch cluster endpoint and auth data and configure kubectl to use the cluster. This is essential for connecting to a GKE cluster.
    - `gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> [flags]`: Create a new GKE cluster.
    - `gcloud container clusters delete <cluster-name> [flags]`: Delete an existing GKE cluster.

    You can set the default project, region, and zone using:
    - `gcloud config set project <project-id>`
    - `gcloud config set compute/region <region>`
    - `gcloud config set compute/zone <zone>`

    Use `gcloud --help` or `gcloud <command> <subcommand> --help` for full syntax and available flags.
